0. Correctness is .... 

1. ensure correctness using static (verification) and dynamic analysis (runtime verification and enforcement)... 

2. verification mainly suffers from state space explosion 

3. runtime verification and enforcement (expressivness and efficiency)

4. synthesis from specification

4.1. specification can be huge 
4.2 code generation? efficiency? underlying platforms? api dependent? 


4.3. 
Correct-by-design was proven to be NP-hard [*] in some cases and undecidability [**]  in some main classical automatic synthesis problems.

We introduce a new technique that can complement existing..... 


relax implementation by allowing more behaviors (race condition...)
